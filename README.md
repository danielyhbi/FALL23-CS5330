# Computer Vision Exploration

## From Daniel
I've been excited to take this class since I enrolled in Northeastern. This serves as a repo for my homework submission, as well as a place to document my learning and explorations in CV.

Not only will I complete the homework per instruction, but I also aim to understand what I've learned! Should be an exciting (and busy) fall!

## Milestones

- [Image Filtering](https://github.com/danielyhbi/FALL23-CS5330/blob/main/project-1/project1-report-danielbi.md)
  - Without using the `openCV` lib, built my own image filtering through matrix manipulations (convolution + multiplication)
- [Content Based Image Retrieval](https://github.com/danielyhbi/FALL23-CS5330/blob/main/project-2/project2.md)
  - Given one image, go find similar images within a database
- Object Recognition
  - WIP
